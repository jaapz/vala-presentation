09:17 < jaapz|work> So, i'm going to do a presentation about vala today at the 
                    company where i'm doing my internship
09:17 < jaapz|work> Anyone have some stuff i really should mention?
09:17 < Digi59404> jaapz|work: Yeah, the fact it's the best language ever.
09:17 < jaapz|work> Digi59404: and now something with which i can convince some 
                    python programmers
09:18 < Digi59404> The fact it's faster than python because it's preprocessed into 
                   C.
09:18 < niagr_> jaapz|work, that the gObject backend could be used to create 
                several languages with different syntax, while still conforming to 
                the platform's C ABI
09:18 < niagr_> jaapz|work, think Vala and Geanie
09:18 < jaapz|work> Genie :)
09:18 < jaapz|work> Right
[ ... ]
09:20 < jaapz|work> But anyone know some bad parts of the language
09:20 < jaapz|work> ?
09:20 -!- m4n1sh [~manish@ubuntu/member/m4n1sh] has joined #elementary-dev
09:20 < Digi59404> it's tied to gObject :)
09:21 < Digi59404> you have to use GTK
09:22 < jaapz|work> Right
