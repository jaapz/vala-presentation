09:17 < jaapz|work> So, i'm going to do a presentation about vala today at the 
                    company where i'm doing my internship
09:17 < jaapz|work> Anyone have some stuff i really should mention?
09:17 < Digi59404> jaapz|work: Yeah, the fact it's the best language ever.
09:17 < jaapz|work> Digi59404: and now something with which i can convince some 
                    python programmers
09:18 < Digi59404> The fact it's faster than python because it's preprocessed into 
                   C.
09:18 < niagr_> jaapz|work, that the gObject backend could be used to create 
                several languages with different syntax, while still conforming to 
                the platform's C ABI
09:18 < niagr_> jaapz|work, think Vala and Geanie
09:18 < jaapz|work> Genie :)
09:18 < jaapz|work> Right

[ ... ]

09:20 < jaapz|work> But anyone know some bad parts of the language
09:20 < jaapz|work> ?
09:20 -!- m4n1sh [~manish@ubuntu/member/m4n1sh] has joined #elementary-dev
09:20 < Digi59404> it's tied to gObject :)
09:21 < Digi59404> you have to use GTK
09:22 < jaapz|work> Right

09:55 < jaapz|work> I'm making a presentation on Vala for the company i'm doing my 
                    internship
09:56 < jaapz|work> Do you know some things i need to add?
09:56 -!- indieross_ [~indieross@ip72-208-215-76.ph.ph.cox.net] has quit [Remote 
          host closed the connection]
09:56 <@Munchor> aw man
09:57 <@Munchor> I can't remember the word npow
09:57 <@Munchor> but speed comparison between languages
09:57 <@Munchor> what's it called?
09:57 <@Munchor> time-something?
10:01 < niagr|away> jaapz|work, you could include that it is one of the few native 
                    languages with the syntactic sugar of java-like languages, 
                    i.e, it does not include the overhead of an interpreter while 
                    still providing automatic memory management and other RAD 
                    features
10:07 <@Munchor> and garbace collection, right?
10:07 <@codygarver> Munchor: you ever heard of posix-fixes?
10:07 <@Munchor> no
10:08 <@codygarver> ah ok
10:08 <@Munchor> what do you call
10:08 <@Munchor> comparison of speed between prog languages?
10:08 <@codygarver> I still couldn't tell you the difference between bandwidth and 
                    throughput
10:09 <@Munchor> !google vala c java time
10:09 <@RabbitBot> http://www.google.com/search?q=vala%20c%20java%20time
10:09 <@Munchor> BENCHMARK
10:09 <@Munchor> that's it
10:10 <@Munchor> jaapz|work, put benchmarks and talk about nativity, speed and Gtk 
                 integration for desktop app development
10:10 <@Munchor> and the lots of bindings available
10:10 <@Munchor> and valdoc.org
10:10 <@Munchor> adios
